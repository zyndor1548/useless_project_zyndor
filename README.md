### Project Description
Zwitter is a social media-inspired web UI designed for animals.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Animals don't have a social platform like Twitter to share their thoughts and moods - Zwitter changes that.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
"Because why should humans have all the social media fun? Zwitter lets animals tweet their thoughts, moods, and moments."
